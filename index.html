      <p>"María is a very organized, thorough and attentive-to-detail professional. As part of the Design team, she was dependable, autonomous, and always understood and stayed aligned with the project's goals.<br>
      She has a mindset for learning, researching and improving her skills, as she is genuinely commited and passionate about her craft.<br>
      She is empathic and has a very valuable sensitiveness to the well-being of her peers. We could always have laid-back and sincere conversations, and she would take and apply feedback in a very sensible way.<br>
      Working with María was great, and I very much trust she will nothing but continue growing and strongly contribute to the projects she will be part of in the future."</p>

      <p>"Working with María is such a smooth experience. She will have you covered no matter what.<br>
      Her impecable work comes from a thorough investigation process, followed by lots of iteration until the result is the best.<br>
      She's not afraid to change stuff around and implement external inputs. Communicating her designs is second nature to her, always with a clear goal and keeping accessibility in mind.<br>
      I really appreciate her as a workmate and I envy all of those who can work with her in the future."</p>
